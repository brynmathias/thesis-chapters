This thesis presents work from an official CMS supersymmetry search as well as 
the measurement of the performance of the \Lone trigger system, performed from 
2010 to 2012. The work presented in Chapters~\ref{cha:level_one_trigger}, 
\ref{cha:the_t_analysis} and \ref{sub:uncertainty_on_signal_efficiency} is mine 
unless otherwise referenced and was carried out with in the context of the 
Imperial College London and CERN SUSY groups as a subsection of the greater CMS 
collaboration. Contributions from others is referenced throughout.

So the journey is coming to an end, working at CERN, analysing some of the 
first data produced at the LHC and recorded with the CMS detector and leaving 
a mark no matter how small on the scientific world is certainly the fulfilment 
of an ambition. However I could not have done this alone and so I would like to 
thank: Robert Bainbridge and Henning Flaecher for their help and direction, 
Alex Tapper for his guidance, supervision and finding me interesting things to 
work on.

I have to thank my contemporaries, Martyn Jarvis, Nick Wardle, Sam Rogerson, 
Alex Shires, Chris Parkinson, Arlo Bryer and Alex Sparrow for many long and 
in-depth discussions, some of them were even relevant. The entire of the RA1 
team, Edward Laird, Markus Stoye, Tanja Rommerskirchen, Burt Betchart, Darren 
Burton, Chris Lucas, Oliver Buchmuller and Paris Sphicas.

Lucie Gauthier, Alex Mott, Massimiliano Chiorboli and Roberto Rossin for their 
help and guidance with all things HLT. Jim Brooke and Greg Iles for their 
expertise with the \Lone trigger.

Finally a large thanks have to go to my family for continued support and 
encouragement though out, also to all of my previous teachers over the years for keeping me on the right track and to Miri for helping me to stay sane in Geneva.
