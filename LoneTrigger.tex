\chapter{\Lone Calorimeter Trigger} % (fold)
\label{cha:level_one_trigger}
In this chapter the \Lone calorimetric triggers are are detailed and their performance is measured with respect to various offline quantities which are defined to match the HLT level objects. The performance is measured under evolving \pu conditions, the impacts of analyses evolving to use \pu corrected offline variables are measured with respect to \Lone quantities. Finally a method for reducing the impact of \pu on \Lone trigger rate with out directly raising the trigger thresholds is studied and the change in performance due to this change is then studied.

The nomenclature for the \Lone trigger algorithms is as follows \verb|L1_AlgoType Threshold| for example \verb|L1_HTT150| refers to a \Lone trigger requiring $\HT > \unit{150}{\GeV}$.

  \label{fig:figures_LoneTrigger_level1trigger}
\end{figure}

The CMS \Lone trigger system\cite{l1} is a pipelined dead-timeless system based 
on custom-built electronics.
The \Lone trigger is a combination of several sub systems, which are 
interconnected as depicted in 
Figure~\ref{fig:figures_LoneTrigger_level1trigger}.

Coarse information from the electromagnetic, hadronic and forward 
calorimeters is processed by the Regional Calorimeter Trigger (RCT), this is 
then passed to the Global Calorimeter Trigger (GCT) where the coarse grain 
information is clustered in to physics objects, these objects are then passed 
to the Global Trigger where the \Lone accept decision is made. Due to the 
limited size of the pipe line this \Lone accept must be issued within 4.0 
$\mu$s.

The objects passed from the GCT to the GT include electro-magnetic objects, 
both electrons and photons as due to the lack of
tracking information at the \Lone trigger these objects are indistinguishable, 
jets and energy sums.

The RCT generates up to 72 isolated and non-isolated electro-magnetic objects, 
these are sorted by rank, which is equivalent to
transverse energy \ET. The four highest ranked electro-magnetic objects are 
then passed via the GCT to the GT at an equivalent data 
rate of 29 \Gbs per type.

Hadronic objects under go two clustering steps. First the transverse energy 
sums of the ECAL and corresponding HCAL towers are
calculated, the towers are then summed in to 4$\times$4 trigger regions, these 
are passed to the GCT at a data rate of 172.8 \Gbs.
These trigger regions are clustered in to jet candidates by the GCT and ranked. 
The jets are then sub-divided in the 
categories depending on their pseudo-rapidity and the result of $\tau$ 
identification. 

Energy sums come in two forms, the total transverse energy \ET which is the 
scalar sum of all transverse energies and the total jet transverse energy \HT 
which is calculated as the scalar sum of all jets above some programable 
threshold.

The missing energy equivalents of these \MET and \MHT are formed from the 
negative vector sum of the objects considered for the
transverse sums.



\section{Level-1 Trigger Jet Algorithm} % (fold)
\label{sec:leve_1_trigger_jet_algorithm}
The \Lone trigger algorithm is detailed explicitly in \cite{gctcomm}.
The CMS detector can be un-rolled in the $\phi$ direction to form a rectangular 
grid of the 396 calorimeter regions, connected along the $\phi$ edge. The
rectangle is formed from 18 $\phi$ divisions (from $-180^{\circ} < \phi \leq 180^{\circ}$) and 22 $\eta$ divisions ( from $-5 < \eta < 5$). Each $\phi$ division corresponds to 20$^{\circ}$. The $\eta$ divisions correspond to $\Delta\eta$ $= 0.5$ in the forward calorimeters and to $\Delta\eta \approx 0.348$ in the barrel. A pictorial representation of this can be seen in 
Figure~\ref{fig:figures_LoneTrigger_jetfindermappings}.

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{figures/LoneTrigger/level1jetalgo.jpg}
  \caption{The 3 $\times$ 3 jet-finder window at \Lone. Each cell represents a 
  trigger tower, which is the sum of the HCAL and ECAL transverse energies. The 
  $\tau$-jet veto patterns are shown to the right.}
  \label{fig:figures_LoneTrigger_level1jetalgo}
\end{figure}


A jet candidate is created if the sum of the ECAL and HCAL energies of the 
central calorimeter region has an energy deposit larger than all of its 
neighbours, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:figures_LoneTrigger_level1jetalgo}
The jet is centred at this region where $p_{T}^{central} > p_{T}^{surrounding}$
and the transverse energies of the surrounding regions are summed in to the 
central region. The jet is then classified as a $\tau$ jet if \mETA $< 3.0$ and 
none of the $\tau$ veto bits are set. If any $\tau$ vetoes are set the jet is 
classified as a central jet. The jet is classified as forward if $ 3.0 < \mETA 
< 5.0$

The $\tau$-vetoes are set by the RCT depending on whether or not the energy 
depositions in up to four contiguous trigger towers are below a programmable 
fraction of the regional \ET as shown in 
Figure~\ref{fig:figures_LoneTrigger_level1jetalgo}. These topologies are due to the hadronic decay mode of the $\tau$ containing one or three isolated pions, any signal that deposits energy in all the trigger towers in a region is not from one or three isolated pions.

It is possible to apply separate jet energy corrections to each of the sub 
categories of GCT jets, however at current the same \ET and $\eta$ dependant 
corrections are used for all three jet types.

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering    
  \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{figures/LoneTrigger/jetfindermappings.png}
  \caption{The calorimeter map that the 3 $\times$ 3 jet-finder operates over
   is made up for 396 calorimeter regions, each jet finder is mapped on to an 
   RCT crate which is composed of an 11 $\times$ 2 strip of these regions. RCT
   crate labels are shown for negative $\eta$ only. }
  \label{fig:figures_LoneTrigger_jetfindermappings}
\end{figure}

In order to reduce the total data duplicated and shared between the jet finders
the GCT employs a pre-clustering algorithm, which involves 18 jet finders 
operating simultaneously over the whole detector. These jet finders then only
share information with neighbouring regions when the clustered jets are found.
Figure~\ref{fig:figures_LoneTrigger_jetfindermappings} shows the boundaries 
between which the jet finders operate, these map naturally on to one RCT crate 
per jet finder. A maximum of 3 jets can be found on each of the $\phi$ strips
acted on by the jet finders, this gives a maximum of 108 jets per event. In
order to preserve continuity across the $\eta = 0$ boundary, the two adjacent
trigger regions are shared between the jet finders.


\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
 \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{figures/LoneTrigger/jetfinderfunction.png}
  \caption{The \Lone jet clustering method, six cells in $\eta$ are shown. An
  example of overlapping jets is shown.\cite{ilesgct}}
  \label{fig:figures_LoneTrigger_jetfinderfunction}
\end{figure}


An example of the jet finding is shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:figures_LoneTrigger_jetfinderfunction}. The first step is to 
create a $2 \times 3$ mini cluster around any local maxima found in the $12 
\times 2$ strip. Equality statements are imposed so that the energy of the 
central cell is greater than its neighbours in some directions and greater than 
or equal to the neighbours other directions to enforce a gap of at least one 
trigger region in both $\eta$ and $\phi$ between the centres of the clustered 
jets.

In the second step the jet finder transfers the three largest mini clusters on 
a given $\phi$ strip to the closest $\phi$ strip on the neighbouring jet finder.
These are then compared against the existing mini clusters in that $\phi$ strip,
those that are adjacent or diagonally adjacent to a larger mini cluster are 
removed. The inequality statements are then reimposed to prevent problems
with clusters having the same energies. In the final stages the mini clusters
have their three adjacent regions summed in to produce a $3 \times 3$ jet
cluster. Finally the four highest ranked jets are corrected and passed to the 
GT.

\section{\Lone Trigger Performance} % (fold)

During the start of data taking in 2010, no \ac{jec} were 
applied in the \Lone trigger. This gave a relatively slow turn on in terms of 
offline hadronic objects.
During the winter shutdown of the \ac{lhc} between the 2010 and 2011 running 
periods a set of \Lone \ac{jec} were developed. These corrections used a peicewise cubic form for the interpolation function used to correct the jet energy dependant on it's uncorrected \ET and $\eta$ values. However as can be seen inFigure~\ref{fig:figures_LoneTrigger_EnCorrelationNormalized} these corrections were only applied to jets with a raw energy below \unit{130}{\GeV}, the secondary lobe shows those objects that do not have their energy corrected.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{figures/LoneTrigger/EnCorrelationNormalized.pdf}
  \caption{Correlation between offline corrected jet energy and \Lone corrected jet energy for matched jets. The discontinuity shows where the \Lone jet corrections do not alter the raw energy of the jet.}
  \label{fig:figures_LoneTrigger_EnCorrelationNormalized}
\end{figure}

To overcome this a new set of corrections were derived using a well established 
tool for producing offline corrections, \todo[inline]{REFERENCE TO tapper-001 here} 
using the same functional form that was derived for correcting particle flow 
jets. \todo[inline]{REFERENCE TO PF HERE}
In this section we discuss the performance of both sets of \Lone \ac{jec} and 
the performance of the energy sum and missing energy triggers \HT, \HTm, and 
\MET, the performance of which are not effected by the application of jet 
energy corrections at the \Lone trigger due to the quantities being built from 
the internal GCT jets before they pass though the corrections look up table.
The performance is studied under both low pile up conditions where the mean 
peak pile up $<PU>$ is 16 primary vertices and under high pile up conditions 
where $<PU>$ is 36 primary vertices.

To measure the performance of the \Lone single jet triggers we assume that the 
leading offline corrected \AK calorimeter (see 
Section~\ref{sub:Preselection_of_hadronic_objects} for a description of the 
offline jet clustering algorithm) jet is the jet that triggered the 
event. We then match this offline jet to the closest \Lone jet in $\Delta$R, 
where for there to be a match $\Delta$R $< 0.5$ is required. For this match 
central, $\tau$ and forward jets are considered. Events where the recorded 
\Lone energy is set to the overflow bit, meaning they have more than 
\unit{254}{\GeV} of \ET measured at \Lone are ignored.

To collect an unbiased sample in which to measure the performance, two 
methods are used; the first is to require a Minimum Bias trigger, which is 
triggered by beam induced activity in the CMS detector.
However due to the nature of these collisions the number of events with high 
energy interactions is low and the prescale applied to this trigger further 
reduces the sample size. However this method does produce the least bias.
The second method is to trigger an object that does not deposit signifiant 
energy in the calorimeter systems, in this case we choose the muon trigger with 
the lowest unprescaled \PT threshold. The muon trigger is chosen with some 
loose isolation requirements to make sure it does not overlap with a jet, 
causing a discrepancy in the measure of the calorimetric energy. The sample has 
a higher number of events due to the large amount of bandwidth given to the 
single object muon triggers in CMS. The use of a muon trigger also serves to 
increase the precision of the measurement of the \Lone missing energy trigger 
as the muons are not seen by the calorimeter system the \MET sample is enriched.

\begin{figure}[htbp]

    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{figures/LoneTrigger/cf_correctionScheemes.pdf}
  \caption{Comparison of the performance of L1$\_$SingleJet16, L1$\_$SingleJet36 and L1$\_$SingleJet92, when using the piecewise cubic corrections and using the new correction scheme. The difference in performance of the two is negligible above 36\GeV.}
  \label{fig:figures_LoneTrigger_cf_correctionScheemes}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:figures_LoneTrigger_cf_correctionScheemes} shows the 
performance of the piecewise cubic corrections (PWC) and the performance of the 
new corrections. The data was taken with the PWC enabled in the GCT hardware. 
The updated corrections were emulated in the bitwise reproduction of the GCT. 
The made an event by event comparison possible. At low \ET the new corrections 
turn on before the PWC corrections, if the new corrections were applied on with 
no change to the trigger menu, the \Lone trigger rate would rise. At a 
threshold of \unit{36}{\GeV} and higher the performance of the two correction 
schemes is very similar. Due to the small change in observed performance and 
the ability to correct raw energies above \unit{130}{\GeV}, the new corrections 
were deployed online after the first machine development period of 2011 and are 
still online at the end of data taking in 2012.

  \caption{Performance measurements of L1$\_$SingleJet16, L1$\_$SingleJet36 and L1$\_$SingleJet92, when using the new correction scheme deployed in the GCT hardware.

  \label{fig:figures_LoneTrigger_SingleMu_JetTurnOns}
\end{figure}

The performance of the updated corrections was then measured with data taken 
with the corrections applied in the GCT hardware. The reference sample was 
taken with a trigger requiring an isolated muon with $\pt > \unit{24}{\GeV}$  (\verb|HLT_IsoMu24_v*|).
The performance of three example triggers is show in 
Figure~\ref{fig:figures_LoneTrigger_SingleMu_JetTurnOns}.
The data collected and represented in 
Figure~\ref{fig:figures_LoneTrigger_SingleMu_JetTurnOns} has a peak mean pile 
up ($<PU>$) of 16 interactions, this is higher than the $<PU>$ of approximately 
8-10 present in Run2011A, on which the previous comparison was performed.
The observed difference in the performance of the \Lone single jet triggers as 
a function of pile up is a case of concern when data taking is underway at continually increasing luminosity and \pu conditions.

The instantaneous luminosity in 2012 was predicted to be \unit{5$\times 10 ^{33}$}{\lumiunits}, with $<PU> \approx$ 32. In order to study the effect on the trigger rate and efficiency a high pile up, low instantaneous luminosity, \ac{lhc} fill was taken in 2011.

The \Lone single jet performance was studied in this run in terms of two 
offline object definitions. The first was the standard \AK calorimeter jet 
reconstruction, the second was a set of \AK calorimeter jets which were 
corrected for pile up using the fastjet correction algorithm, which is further 
detailed in Section~\ref{sub:Preselection_of_hadronic_objects}.
The fast-jet corrections remove the energy deposited by the secondary 
interactions from the objects which are expected to come from the primary hard 
interaction, thus removing energy from the offline jets.
The effect of these pile up corrections on the \Lone trigger performance is 
first studied under conditions with $<PU>$ of 16, the performance of which has 
already been measured with respect to non pile up corrected offline objects, as 
a sanity check. The results are shown in 
Figure~\ref{fig:figures_LoneTrigger_LowPUFastCompare} , the performance is 
measured with respect to \verb|HLT_IsoMu24_v*|, in terms of both pile up 
corrected and standard offline objects. As expected the performance in the two 
cases is very similar. The same comparison is shown for \HT in 
Figure~\ref{fig:figures_LoneTrigger_LowPUFastCompareHT}, where the effect of 
the fastjet\cite{Cacciari:2011ma} corrections is more pronounced due to the sum over jets. The difference between the turn on points for the two offline quantities is on the order of \unit{10}{\GeV} under low pile up conditions.

Due to the high pile up fill being a specialised fill with low instantaneous 
luminosity, the high level trigger paths were disabled, instead \Lone trigger 
pass though paths were utilised to take the data. The \Lone single muon pass 
though trigger is used to collect the reference sample. Otherwise the same 
analysis method is common between the two data sets.
Figure~\ref{fig:figures_LoneTrigger_HighFastCompare} shows the difference in 
turn on for three example \Lone single jet triggers when using standard 
calorimeter jets and fastjet corrected calorimeter jets.
In the high pile up conditions the switch to offline jets that are corrected 
for pile up shifts the turn on point to lower vales of \ET, the magnitude of 
this effect reduces as the \Lone trigger trigger threshold raises. This implies 
that the same offline performance as seen in the low pile up conditions can be 
achieved by using the pile up corrected offline objects and raising the \Lone 
single jet trigger thresholds.

Figure~\ref{fig:figures_LoneTrigger_HighPUFastCompareHT} shows the same high 
pile up comparison, but for the \Lone \HT triggers. Due to the size of the 
sample the precision of this measurement is low. However the same trend of a 
shift to lower \HT values of the turn on point of the \Lone triggers when using 
pile up corrected offline objects is observed. This again implies that the 
\Lone \HT trigger thresholds can be raised whilst preserving the same offline 
performance as during the low pile up conditions.

  \label{fig:figures_LoneTrigger_HighPUFastCompareHT}
\end{figure}

The performance of each of the \Lone triggers is then reported to the analysis 
users so that high level trigger paths can be designed with the \Lone 
constraints in mind. These measurements are also used when designing new \Lone 
trigger menus where the requirement for taking the correct data has to be 
balanced against the total trigger rate of the \Lone menu.

\section{\Lone Trigger Pile-up Mitigation} % (fold)
\label{sub:lone_trigger_pile_up_mitigation}


Whilst we have seen that the offline performance of the \Lone hadronic triggers 
can be maintained when raising the trigger thresholds to deal withincreased 
rate, when switching to pile up corrected offline objects. 
Figure~\ref{fig:figures_HTT150_pileup} shows the trigger cross section as a 
function of instantaneous luminosity for the \verb|L1_HTT150| trigger, which 
requires \HT $>$ \unit{150}{\GeV}. However beyond a certain point raising 
thresholds causes a loss of performance.
In this section we look at a method to reduce the effects of pile up hadronic 
\Lone triggers, by making an addition to the \Lone jet finding algorithm.

In Section~\ref{sec:leve_1_trigger_jet_algorithm} the \Lone jet clustering 
algorithm was described. The proposed change was to add a requirement that the 
seeding region has a direct energy threshold, in addition to the equality 
relations that are set up. The effects of applying a \unit{2}{\GeV} and a 
\unit{5}{\GeV} threshold are studied. This threshold is on the raw, uncorrected 
energy of the trigger regions and effects all \Lone jets. The impact will be 
seen in the \Lone jet triggers which use corrected energy and \Lone \HT and 
\HTm which are formed from uncorrected jets.
The aim is to remove the events which are accepted due to pile up, but not to 
remove physics events.

The triggers most effected by this change are the energy sum triggers as they 
sum many jets of low threshold, where as the single object triggers are already 
cutting on high \ET objects.

Figure~\ref{fig:GCTrankRAW} shows the internal GCT uncorrected jet energy 
spectrum in high pile up conditions, taken with the \verb|L1_SingleMu| pass 
though triggers. The three histograms are for; no application of jet seed 
threshold in black, where there are many low \ET jets; In red a \unit{2}{\GeV} 
seed requirement is made, the effect is to cut out all jets below 
\unit{2}{\GeV} and cut out jets with an energy up to approximately 
\unit{35}{\GeV} of uncorrected energy; The blue histogram shows the jet energy 
spectrum after applying a \unit{5}{\GeV} seed threshold, the effect is to 
remove all jets below \unit{5}{\GeV} and to cut out jets with energy up to 
\unit{55}{\GeV}. Figure~\ref{fig:GCTrankRatio} shows the efficiency with 
respect to the no seed sample for the two test seed thresholds. The removal of 
jets in the low energy region of the \ET spectrum due to the jet stemming from \pu rather than collimated objects is where the advantage of applying a seed threshold is seen over simply raising the trigger thresholds,or raising the threshold of jets to be included in the \Lone \HT or \HTm calculation.

\end{figure}



To quantify the effects of the addition of the jet seed a low pile up sample, 
where the effects are expected to be small, is studied in terms of rate 
reduction and efficiency change. The dedicated high pile up fill is then 
studied in terms of rate reduction, due to the limited sample size of the high 
pile up fill the change in efficiency on this sample is not studied. However 
due to the addition of energy from the secondary pile up interactions the 
change in efficiency in the low pile up sample is the worse case scenario.

Table~\ref{tab:lowpuratereduction} details the rate reduction with respect to 
the \unit{0}{\GeV} seed threshold for seed thresholds of \unit{2}{\GeV} and 
\unit{5}{\GeV} for three example triggers, these are:

\begin{itemize}
\item \verb|L1_SingleJet50|, which requires at least one jet with \ET $>$ \unit{50}{\GeV} within \mETA $<$ 3.0;
\item \verb|L1_QuadJet38|, which requires 4 jets with \ET $>$ \unit{38}{\GeV} within \mETA $<$ 3.0;
\item \verb|L1_HTT100|, which requires that  \Lone \HT $>$ \unit{100}{\GeV}.
\end{itemize}

The rate of \verb|L1_SingleJet50| is not effected by the requirement of a 
\unit{2}{\GeV} seed threshold and is reduced by 15$\%$ when a \unit{5}{\GeV} 
seed requirement is made.
The \verb|L1_QuadJet38| trigger rate is reduced by the same amount as the 
single jet trigger, under low pile up conditions for both seed thresholds. 
\verb|L1_HTT100| sees a 2$\%$ rate reduction when requiring a \unit{2}{\GeV} 
seed threshold and a 3$\%$ reduction in rate when requiring a \unit{5}{\GeV} seed.

\begin{table}
\caption{Summary of rate reduction during low pile up conditions.}
\footnotesize
\begin{tabular}{c|c|c}

\hline

\end{table}

Table~\ref{tab:highpuratereduction} shows the rate reduction under high pile up 
conditions with respect to the \unit{0}{\GeV} seed threshold requirement, for 
the same three example triggers as in the low pile up case. The rate of 
\verb|L1_SingleJet50| is not reduced when making a \unit{2}{\GeV} seed 
requirement, when making a \unit{5}{\GeV} seed requirement the single jet 
\unit{50}{\GeV} rate is reduced by 30$\%$. The rate of \verb|L1_QuadJet38| is 
reduced by 30$\%$ when requiring a \unit{2}{\GeV} seed and by 40$\%$ when 
requiring a \unit{5}{\GeV} seed.
The rate of \verb|L1_HTT100| is reduced by 40$\%$ when requiring a 
\unit{2}{\GeV} seed threshold and when requiring a \unit{5}{\GeV} seed 
threshold the rate is reduced by $\approx$ 99$\%$, however the statistical 
error on this prediction is large.

\label{sec:Effects of requiring a jet seed on offline efficiency}
Section~\ref{sub:lone_trigger_pile_up_mitigation} shows that requiring a jet 
seed threshold substantially reduces the trigger acceptance rate at in high 
pile up conditions.

However the aim of requiring a jet seed is to reduce rate, but not at the cost 
of physics. In this section we look at the effects of requiring a seed 
threshold, whilst requiring some loose, generic offline selection on the 
hadronic objects.

The change in efficiency is measured under low pile up conditions where the 
least extra energy added to the event. This gives a worse case estimate of the 
effect of requiring a jet seed on the offline efficiency.

Each offline reconstructed calorimeter jet must adhere to the following quality 
criteria:
\begin{itemize}
\item Pass loose calorimeter ID\cite{CaloJetID};
\item \PT $\geq$ \unit{30}{\GeV};
\item $|\eta| \leq$ 3.0;
\item Matched to a \Lone jet with $\Delta R \leq 0.5$.

\subsection{Efficiency of \HT Triggers} % (fold)
\label{par:Efficneicy of HT triggers}
Figure~\ref{fig:HTlowPURECO} shows the acceptance reduction after applying the 
two jet seed thresholds. The distribution is the cumulative number of events 
passing a cut of $L1~HT^{cut}$ in bins of \unit{25}{\GeV}. Since \HT is the 
scalar sum of the jet \PT's in the event the value of \Lone \HT is reduced as 
jets are removed from the calculation. To preserve efficiency the \Lone trigger 
threshold will have to be reduced. When comparing to the high pile up rate 
reduction in table~\ref{tab:highpuratereduction} it is shown that the trigger 
rate can be reduced by $\approx 20\%$ when requiring a \unit{2}{\GeV} seed 
threshold and reduced by $\geq 99\%$ when requiring a \unit{5}{\GeV} seed 
threshold, for a trigger threshold of 100 \unit{100}{\GeV}.

\subsection{Efficiency of Jet Triggers} % (fold)
\label{par:Efficiency of Jet Triggers}
Figure~\ref{fig:cenJetLowPURECO} shows the change in acceptance of jets in low 
pile up conditions when the two seed thresholds are required. The effect is on 
the order of a few percent for each of the thresholds. Requiring a 
\unit{2}{\GeV} seed reduces the efficiency for jets above \unit{50}{\GeV} by 
$\approx 2.5\%$, whilst requiring a 5\GeV seed reduces the efficiency of the 
same jets by $\approx 4\%$.

\subsection{Efficiency of MultiJet Triggers} % (fold)
\label{par:Efficiency of MultiJet Triggers}
Figure~\ref{fig:quadJetLowPURECO} shows that the effect of requiring a seed 
threshold of \unit{2}{\GeV} has no effect on the efficiency of the quad jet 
\unit{38}{\GeV} trigger and requiring a seed threshold of \unit{5}{\GeV} 
reduces the efficiency of the quad jet 38 trigger by $8\%$. The change in rate 
is dramatic in high pile up conditions where for a \unit{2}{\GeV} seed 
threshold the rate is reduced by $\approx 30\%$ and by $\approx 40\%$ when 
requiring a \unit{5}{\GeV} seed. However it is to be noted that the sample 
where this measurement has been made is of limited size, inferring a reasonably 
large statistical uncertainty.

\section{Summary} % (fold)
\label{sec:Summary}
The effects of requiring a jet seed have been studied using the \Lone trigger 
emulator on high and low pile-up samples. The studies show that requiring a jet 
seed of \unit{5}{\GeV} greatly reduces the rate of the \HT and Multi Jet triggers in 
high pile up conditions, whilst not adversely effecting the data taking 
efficiency of these triggers.

The cross section of L1$\_$HTT150 has been measured with and with out the 
addition of a jet seed threshold of \unit{5}{\GeV} as shown in  
Figure~\ref{fig:figures_HTT150_pileup}. Ideally the trigger cross section would 
be independent of the instantaneous luminosity and pile up, 
Figure~\ref{fig:figures_HTT150_pileup} shows that the addition of a 
\unit{5}{\GeV} seed threshold reduces the dependance on instantaneous 
luminosity of the trigger cross section.
