\chapter{Background Prediction} % (fold)

The raw number of events in the signal region is meaningless with out 
an accurate background prediction, as discussed earlier taking the background 
estimation from simulation is not viable due to the requirement of high order 
theory calculations on the cross sections of \ac{sm} processes involving 
jets, these have many divergencies due to the nature of QCD. Instead the 
simulation is used to form a translation factor between two samples measured in 
data, a control sample which closely mimics the \ac{sm} processes 
producing missing energy, but has a visible muon or photon in the final state. 
The background estimation methods are described and the background predictions 
stated in this chapter.

\section{Electro-Weak Background Prediciton} % (fold)
\label{sec:electro_weak_background_prediciton}

The requirement of an \alt cut on the signal sample removes multi-jet QCD 
events where a balanced event is counted as signal due to mismeasurements, 
the remaining background events in the signal region are due to electro-weak 
processes which produce real missing energy. Primarily these events are 
produced from \HepProcess{\PZ\to\Pnu\APnu}~+~Jets, 
\HepProcess{\PW\to\Pl\APnu}~+~Jets and \HepProcess{\Ptop\APtop} decay, with 
smaller contributions from Drell-Yan + Jets, single top production in the s,t 
and tW channels and from di-boson + Jet events. To predict the number of these 
events contributing to the number of signal like events three control samples 
are defined and though the use of a Montecarlo derived transfer factor the 
control samples are used to predict the number of \ac{sm} events expected in 
the signal region.


Figure~\ref{fig:figures_Analysis_MCexpectation}\cite{CMS-AN-11-517} shows the 
expectation from simulation in all bins of the hadronic signal region, for the 
different background samples and an example CMSSM reference model RM1 where $m_0=\unit{320}{\GeV}$, $m_{1/2}=\unit{520}{\GeV}$, $A_0=0$ and $\tan\beta=10$. 
The expected composition of the the backgrounds in the hadronic signal region, 
as a percentage of the total \ac{sm} background, are summarised in 
Table~\ref{tab:bg-compositions}. \HepProcess{\PZ\to\nu\nu} contributes 
$\approx$43$\%$ of the \ac{sm} background in the 
\unit{275}{\GeV}--\unit{325}{\GeV} \HT bin, raising to $\approx$53$\%$ in the 
\HT $>$ \unit{875}{\GeV} bin. Events entering the signal region due to \PZ or 
\PW decays where the lepton is missed by the lepton vetoes account for 
$\approx$25$\%$ at low \HT and $\approx$13$\%$ at high \HT. Events from 
hadronicly decays \Ptau ($\tau_{h}$) have a low \HT dependance, contributing 
$\approx$22$\%$ of the background at low \HT and $\approx$27$\%$ of the 
background at high \HT. Those events arising from \Ptau particles which decay leptonically ($\tau_{l}$) and are missed by the lepton vetoes account for $\approx$10$\%$ of the \ac{sm} background.

To calculate the bin by bin translation factors the signal selection and the 
individual control selections are applied to the montecarlo simulated 
background samples. The ratio of the number of accepted events is then taken, 
the signal yield prediction is computed from applying the the control 
selections to real data and multiplying the event yield by the translation 
factor. The measurements form all control samples are considered simultaneously 
in a fit defined in Section~\ref{sec:likelihood_model}. This method can be 
extended to high dimensions of analysis bins, for example in 
\cite{CMS-PAS-SUS-12-028} a secondary dimension involving the number 
of \HepProcess{\PB} quarks in the event is studied. However the 
\HepProcess{\PB} extension is not detailed in this thesis.

\begin{equation}
  N^{sig}_{prediction}\left(\HT\right) = N_{obs}^{control}\left(\HT\right) \times \frac{N_{MC}^{sig}\left(\HT\right)}{N_{MC}^{control}\left(\HT\right)}
\label{eq:traslationfactor}
\end{equation}


The three control samples used are a \HepProcess{\PW\to\Pmu\APnu}~+~Jets 
sample, a \HepProcess{\PZ\to\Pmu\Pmu}~+~Jets sample and a 
\HepProcess{\Pphoton}~+~Jets sample.

The selection criteria for each of these control samples is kept as similar to 
the signal selection as possible, so as to not introduce systematic errors from 
incorrect modelling in the simulation. The use of the ratio of the number of 
observed events in the montecarlo cancels the systematic effects. A systematic 
is still assigned to each translation factor to account for theoretical 
uncertainties and acceptance and instrumental effects.

Additional kinematic cuts are applied in the two muon control samples to enrich 
the \HepProcess{\PW}~+~Jets \HepProcess{\Ptop\APtop} and 
\HepProcess{\PZ}~+~Jets components in the control samples. The samples are 
defined to maximised efficiency rather than purity, any impurities are 
accounted for in the transfer factors as the yields from all montecarlo samples 
are used. This is valid under the assumption that the \ac{sm} 
electro-weak and Drell-Yan processes are well modelled by the simulation.
The possibility of SUSY like signal contamination in the control samples is 
accounted for in the final likelihood, after measuring the signal acceptance 
for the control samples on simulated SUSY events.

The magnitude of the systematic uncertainties on the transfer factors is 
motivated by a set of closure tests between the control samples. A transfer 
factor is produced to predict each control sample from each of the other 
control samples. No assumed systematic is applied in these closure tests, 
instead the level of agreement within statistical uncertainty is used to set 
the scale of the systematic error for each \HT bin.


\subsection{The $\mu$~+~Jets control sample} % (fold)
\label{par:the_mu_jets_control_sample}
The $\mu$~+~Jets control sample is designed to mimic the events appearing in 
the signal region due to \HepProcess{\PW}~+~Jets and \HepProcess{\Ptop\APtop} 
decays where the leptons are missed offline, either due to falling out of 
acceptance or being missed by the reconstruction algorithms. Hadronic tau 
decays from high \PT W bosons are also predicted from this sample.
The additional selection criteria for this sample are designed to select events 
containing the decay \HepProcess{\PW\to\mu\nu}~+~Jets in the same kinematic 
conditions as those events entering the signal selection. Offline the event 
level discriminators, \HT and \alt, are calculated using only the hadronic 
components of the event. In order to select the \HepProcess{\PW} exactly one 
tightly identified, isolated muon within \mETA $<$ 2.5 with \PT $>$ 
\unit{10}{\GeV} is required. The transverse mass of the muon combined with the 
missing energy of the event $M_{T}(\mu,\MET)$ is required to be larger than 
\unit{30}{\GeV}, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:figures_Analysis_Wmunu_pfMT} the 
transverse mass cut removes a large amount of QCD whilst preserving a high 
efficiency \HepProcess{\PW} selection. Events are vetoed if for any jet $\Delta 
R(\mu,Jet) < 0.5$, or if a second muon candidate exists that is either loose, 
non-isolated or outside of acceptance if the two muons have an invariant mass 
within $\pm$\unit{25}{\GeV} of the \PZ mass, to suppress 
\HepProcess{\PZ\to\mu\mu} events.

\subsection{The $\mu\mu$~+~Jets control sample} % (fold)
\label{par:the_mumu_jets_control_sample}
The $\mu\mu$~+~Jets control sample is used to measure the 
\HepProcess{\PZ\to\nu\nu}~+~Jets irreducible background in the signal region. 
The process \HepProcess{\PZ\to\mu\mu}~+~Jets is identical kinematically, 
however the acceptance and the branching ratio are both smaller the branching 
ratio due to the possible decay in to one of three neutrino flavour states 
verses the requirement of a particular lepton flavour, the acceptance 
difference is due to the \PT and identification quality requirements on the 
muons alter the acceptance between the two processes. The following selection 
criteria are applied on top of the common selection: Exactly two tightly 
identified, isolated muons, within \mETA $<$ 2.5 with \PT $>$ \unit{10}{\GeV} 
are required; The invariant mass of the di-muon pair is required to be within 
$\pm$\unit{25}{\GeV} of the \PZ mass; Events are vetoed if for any muon and jet 
combination $\Delta R(\mu,Jet) < 0.5$. As in the single muon control sample all 
event level quantities are calculated from the hadronic objects alone. This 
control sample can be used in all of the offline \HT bins.
% paragraph the_mumu_jets_control_sample (end)

\subsection{The \Pphoton~+~Jets control sample} % (fold)
\label{par:the_pphoton_jets_control_sample}
The \Pphoton~+~Jets control sample can also be used to measure the 
\HepProcess{\PZ\to\nu\nu}~+~Jets background as the \Pphoton~+~Jets process is 
kinematically similar when the \Pphoton \ET $>$ 
$\approx$~\unit{100}{\GeV}\cite{PAS-SUS-08-002,Bern:2011pa}, again when 
calculating the event level quantities only hadronic objects are considered.
The photon sample requires the following criteria on top of the common 
selection requirements: Exactly one photon with \ET $>$ \unit{150}{\GeV} to 
ensure trigger efficiency, \mETA $<$ 1.45. Events are vetoed if for any jet 
$\Delta R(\Pphoton,jet) < 1.0$. Given that due to the trigger requirements the 
photon \ET is required to be greater than \unit{150}{\GeV} and the photon is 
treated as missing energy, the \alt $>$ 0.55 requirement implies a minimum \HT 
threshold of $\approx$~\unit{350}{\GeV}, hence the \Pphoton~+~Jets control 
sample can only be used in the offline region where \HT $>$ \unit{375}{\GeV}.
% paragraph the_pphoton_jets_control_sample (end)

Table~\ref{tab:total-sm-pred-mu} gives the hadronic signal yields in each of 
the offline \HT bins along with the simple background estimate from the single 
muon plus jets control sample. The full background prediction is given from the 
results of the simultaneous fit to the separate background estimates.

\subsection{Muon control samples with out an \alt cut.} % (fold)
\label{par:muon_control_samples_with_out_an_alt_cut_}
  
The requirement of an \alt value above 0.55 in the previous control samples 
limits the event yield of each of the montecarlo samples, increasing the 
statistical error of the prediction. This is especially evident when splitting 
the analysis in to more dimensions than the \HT binning. The requirement of an 
\alt cut on the control samples means that as the muon is not seen by the 
calorimeter systems the signal trigger can also be used to collect the both the 
single and di muon background samples.
The translation factor method can be used to create a prediction from any 
sample to any other sample if and only if the modelling of the event kinematics 
and acceptances of any cuts introduces no large systematic errors. We now show 
that the montecarlo simulation accurately reproduces the kinematics and 
acceptance of the \alt cut when applied to electro-weak background samples, 
enabling the removal of the \alt requirement for the muon control samples.


The preselection of events in the two muon control samples ensures samples 
with negligible QCD contamination, which are enriched with 
\HepProcess{\Ptop\APtop}, \PW~+~Jets and \PZ~+~Jet events. This is shown for 
the \Pmu~+~Jets sample in Figure~\ref{fig:singleMuControl} and for the 
\HepProcess{\Pmu\Pmu}~+~Jets sample in Figure~\ref{fig:diMuControl}, in 
both sets of plots the expected number of QCD events from montecarlo simulation 
is less than one event at any \alt value for \unit{5}{\invfb} of integrated 
luminosity. The requirement of tight isolation on each of the muons is largely 
responsible for the purity of the sample, the transverse mass and di-muon mass 
window cuts ensure the sample is rich in electro-weak events with visible muons.
The agreement between data and montecarlo in these plots is good and the simulation models the \alt acceptance well, the systematic assigned to this acceptance is detailed in Section~\ref{sec:systematic_uncertainties_on_the_electro_weak_background_model_}.

Moving to a selection where there is no required \alt cut means that the \alt 
trigger suite can not be used to collect the high event yield control samples. 
Instead a trigger requiring \HT and a muon in the final state (\muht) is used, 
due to the muon trigger threshold the \PT acceptance cut is raised to 
\unit{45}{\GeV} in these control samples. The \HT requirement on these triggers 
raises to \unit{300}{\GeV} so only the offline bins with \HT $>$ 
\unit{375}{\GeV} are able to benefit from the increased background estimation 
precision, due to the larger size of the predicting sample. The efficiency for 
triggering on a single muon at \unit{45}{\GeV} is measured to be 
91.3$\pm$0.1$\%$ though out the data taking period, measured for the 
\HT~+~single muon triggers, the \HT component of the trigger is measured to be 
100$\%$ efficient though out. In the case of the di-muon sample, as both muons 
have to be above \unit{45}{\GeV} and either of them could have triggered the 
event, the efficiency is found to be \HT-dependant in the range of 95-97$\%$.

The muon control samples in the \HT bins where \HT $<$ \unit{375}{\GeV} are 
collected with the \alt trigger suite and the measured efficiencies are the 
same as those measured for the hadronic sample. The details of the triggers 
used for each of the muon~+~Jets control samples are listed in 
Table~\ref{tab:triggers-mu-mumu}.

As previously discussed in Section~\ref{sec:electro_weak_background_prediciton} 
the final background prediction is given by the simultaneous fit to the yields 
in the signal and control samples and the translation factors obtained from MC. 
The fit has some freedom via the statistical and systematic uncertainties 
measured for each translation factor. This implies that the measurement of the 
systematic uncertainties on the translation factors are vital for the fitting 
procedure.

A set of closure tests were performed on data to identify any sources of 
systematic biased introduced by the background prediction method.
To do this the individual background samples are used to predict one another 
using the same translation factor method as for the prediction of \ac{sm} 
missing energy sources in the hadronic signal regions. The level of agreement 
is quantified in terms of the ratio $\left(N_{obs} - N_{pred}\right)/N_pred$, 
the statistical error from the translation factor, based on the available 
Montecarlo statists is combined with the statistical error on the number of 
events in the predicting sample to give the error on the closure, hence the 
deviation of the ratio from zero gives the level of closure per analysis bin. 
This gives a measure of any biases introduced by the background estimation 
method.

The closure tests between the background samples are designed to test the 
Montecarlo's ability to model kinematic effects; such as the \alt acceptance; 
\Pmu acceptance and \Pphoton acceptance, instrumental effects such as; 
reconstruction efficiencies and the effects of pile up on isolation and finally 
the theoretical precision of the production and decay cross sections and their 
relative contributions to the \ac{sm} background. These individual components 
are not separable by the closure tests, which instead gives a total systematic 
error estimation.

As described in Section~\ref{par:muon_control_samples_with_out_an_alt_cut_} the 
control samples which do not require an \alt cut use a \muht cross object 
trigger to collect the data events. As shown in Table~\ref{tab:muht-triggers} 
there was a period of data taking where due to the increased trigger thresholds 
the \muht triggers are unsuitable for use in the region \HT $<$ 
\unit{375}{\GeV}. Thusly in the closure tests between the control samples which 
use an \alt cut and those that do not the integrated luminosity is limited to 
\unit{3.9}{\invfb}. This causes a loss of some statistical power in these cases.

The individual closure tests and fits to the \HT dependance of the ratio 
$\left(N_{obs} - N_{pred}\right)/N_{pred}$ are shown in 
Appendix~\ref{sec:Closure_tests_and_systematic_uncertainties}.
The Figures~\ref{fig:closure-with-alphat1} show the closure of the prediction 
between \Pmu~+~Jets(no \alt) $\rightarrow$ \Pmu~+~Jets(\altg) and $\mu\mu$~+~Jets(no \alt) $\rightarrow$ 
$\mu\mu$~+~Jets(\altg) for two samples, one with no requirement on the number of \Pbottom 
tagged jets ($n_{b}$), which increases the precision of the measurement, and 
one requiring $n_{b} = 1$, the read line is the result of a one parameter fit. 
The level of closure shows that the Montecarlo accurately models the \alt 
acceptance, with no significant bias.

Figure~\ref{fig:closure-with-alphat2} shows the closure between \Pmu~+~Jets 
$\rightarrow$ $\mu\mu$~+~Jets and between \Pphoton+jets $\rightarrow$ $\mu\mu$~+~Jets over both the 
full \HT range using only \unit{3.9}{\invfb} of integrated luminosity and for 
\HT $>$ \unit{375}{\GeV} using the full data set. Again the red lines are the 
result of fitting with a one parameter fit.

Figure~\ref{fig:btag-multi-closure} tests the closure between samples with 
differing $n_{b}$ the three tests are \Pmu~+~Jets($n_b = 0$)$\rightarrow$\Pmu~+~Jets($n_b = 
1$,no \alt), \Pmu~+~Jets($n_b = 1$)$\rightarrow$\Pmu~+~Jets($n_b > 1$,no \alt) and \Pmu~+~Jets($n_b = 
0$)$\rightarrow$\Pmu~+~Jets($n_b > 1$,no \alt). Figure~\ref{fig:btag-samples} also 
tests the closure between samples with differing $n_{b}$, here the test is 
between \Pmu~+~Jets($n_b = 0$)$\rightarrow$$\mu\mu$~+~Jets($n_b = 0$) and \Pmu~+~Jets($n_b =  
1$)$\rightarrow$$\mu\mu$~+~Jets($n_b = 1$).

Finally any dependance on pile up is measured by comparing a subset of the 
individual closure tests between samples which have pile up subtracted jets and 
those that do not. The example closures are \Pmu~+~Jets(no \alt)$\rightarrow$\Pmu~+~Jets(\altg),
\Pmu~+~Jets(no \alt)$\rightarrow$$\mu\mu$~+~Jets(no \alt), and \Pmu~+~Jets($n_b = 0$)$\rightarrow$\Pmu~+~Jets($n_b 
= 1$,no \alt).

\section{Motivating the combined systematic on the translation factors}
 % (fold)
\label{sub:motivating_the_combined_systematic_on_the_translation_factors}
The closure tests described in the previous section are combined to give a 
total systematic uncertainty. This uncertainty is binned in to three \HT 
regions \unit{275}{\GeV}$\rightarrow$\unit{575}{\GeV}, 
\unit{575}{\GeV}$\rightarrow$\unit{775}{\GeV} and \unit{775}{\GeV}+. In each of 
these regions all of the individual closure tests are used to calculate a 
weighted mean and variance. The systematic is defined as $3\sigma$ of this 
variance, which is conservative but necessary to cover any biases. The 
systematics are treated as fully uncorrelated between the three regions, again 
this is the conservative approach. Figure~\ref{fig:closure-summary} shows the 
key example closures, the grey shaded region shows the systematic error. The 
values obtained for the error are 6$\%$, 20$\%$ and 39$\%$, these are rounded 
to 10$\%$, 20$\%$ and 40$\%$ and then used in the final background simultaneous 
fit.

\section{Estimating the residual QCD background 
component.} % (fold)
\label{sec:estimating_the_residual_qcd_background_component_}
The expected QCD contamination in the signal region where \HT $>$
\unit{275}{\GeV} and \altg from simulated background samples is 
negligible\cite{CMS-AN-11-517}, residual events are removed via the application 
of the detector failure and \Rmiss $<$ 1.25 filters. However due to the 
difficulty in simulating QCD multi-jet events accurately a conservative 
approach is taken where a term is inserted in the likelihood to model any 
residual QCD contamination.

The term is based on the ratio of the number of events above and below the \alt 
threshold of 0.55 in the individual \HT bins. The dependance of this ratio is 
modelled as an exponentially falling quantity:
\begin{equation}
  R_{\alt}\left(\HT\right)=\mathcal{A}_{n_{b}}e^{-\kqcd\HT}
\end{equation}
Where $\mathcal{A}_{n_{b}}$ is the b-tag bin dependant normalisation factor and 
\kqcd is the b-tag dependant decay constant.

The exponential behaviour is due to several features, the first of which is the 
improvement of the jet energy resolution with \HT due to the larger energies 
deposited in the calorimeter systems. Secondly for the region \HT $>$ 
\unit{375}{\GeV} the jet multiplicity rises slowly with \HT, which due to the 
combinatorics  used in the \alt calculation, results in a narrower \alt 
distribution peaked at 0.5. Due to the signal region definition and the 
exponentially falling nature of the QCD background component is reduced to zero 
above $\approx$~\unit{500}{\GeV}, thus the validity of the QCD background model 
above \unit{575}{\GeV} is not of consequence to the final analysis, however the 
model chosen is shown to be valid over the whole \HT region of the analysis as 
shown below.

\ac{ml} values for \kqcd and $\mathcal{A}_{n_{b}}$ are found by the final 
likelihood fit, however \kqcd is first constrained by a measurement in a 
background enriched side band regions where either the \alt cut is relaxed or 
the \Rmiss cut is inverted. Figure~\ref{fig:figures_qcd_side-bands} depicts the 
regions where \kqcd is measured, the signal region is as described before where 
\altg and \Rmiss $<$ 1.25 are required. Region B is defined by the inversion of 
the \alt cut. Region C is defined by inverting both the \alt requirement and 
the \Rmiss requirement, this region is further divided in to three slices in 
\alt of $0.52 < \alt < 0.53$, $0.53 < \alt < 0.54$ and $0.54 < \alt < 0.55$, as 
the index of C$_{i}$ rises the expected amount of QCD in that control region 
increases. Finally region D has only the \Rmiss requirement inverted, region D 
is not used to constrain \kqcd, but instead to check the validity of the 
exponential model.
\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{figures/Analysis/qcd_plots/side-bands.pdf}
  \caption{QCD side-band regions, used for determination of \kqcd.}
  \label{fig:figures_qcd_side-bands}
\end{figure}
The fits to the individual side bands are shown in 
Appendix~\ref{sec:addition_information_on_background_estimation_methods}.
The best fit value for \kqcd of \unit{2.96~$\pm$~0.64~$\times 
10^{-2}$}{\GinveV} obtained from region $B$ is used as the central value of the 
constraint. The assumption that this method gives an unbiased estimate of \kqcd 
stems from the similarity in event kinematics in the two \alt regions.
The best fit values for the three $C_{i}$ regions are used to estimate the 
systematic uncertainty on the central value obtained from region $B$. The fit 
results show now dependance on the \alt region used to measure the number of 
events, supporting the assumption that region $B$ provides an unbiased estimate 
of \kqcd. The variation of the measured values for each $C_{i}$ slice are used 
to calculate the error on the central value, the weighted mean and standard 
deviation of the three slices in \alt are calculated to be 
\unit{1.13~$\pm$~0.26~$\times~10^{-2}$}{\GinveV}, the relative error on this 
value is 20$\%$ which is then applied to the central value to give an estimate 
of the systematic uncertainty.

The data side bands are used to provide a constrained value of \kqcd as an 
input to the final likelihood model which describes the expected number of 
background events in bins of \HT and the number of observed jets containing a 
\Pbottom quark. The value measured for \kqcd is 
\unit{2.96~$\pm$~0.61(stat)~$\pm$~0.46(sys)~$\times~10^{-2}$}{\GinveV}. The 
uncertainty values are used as penalty timers in the likelihood model which is 
described in Section~\ref{sec:likelihood_model}

  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

A final check is performed using region $D$, which requires \altg but has no 
\Rmiss cut, this introduces QCD background in to the signal region. The 
likelihood fit is performed on this background enriched region and no 
constraint is applied on \kqcd which is then determined by the fit only. The 
fit is performed over the full \HT range used in the final analysis.
Figure~\ref{fig:qcd-fit} shows the resulting fit, the \ac{ml} value obtained 
for \kqcd is \unit{(1.31 $\pm$ 0.09)$\times 10^{-2}$}{\GinveV}, this value is 
in excellent agreement with the value found from the weighed mean of the 
regions $C_{i}$, secondly the fit shows that the choice of exponential function 
used in the likelihood model is valid over the entire \HT range. This supports 
the assumption that region $B$ provides an unbiased estimate of \kqcd in the 
signal region \altg and \Rmiss $<$ 1.25.

\section{Likelihood model} % (fold)
\label{sec:likelihood_model}
\paragraph{Declaration} % (fold)
\label{par:declaration-likelihood}
The likelihood model was implemented, developed, commissioned and deployed in 
anger by Edward Laird and is best described in his thesis\cite{ted}. However 
for completeness the likelihood model is described in this section.
% paragraph declaration (end)
The likelihood is used to gauge the agreement between the observed yields in 
the hadronic signal region and the predicted yields obtained from the control 
samples.
For the hadronic sample the likelihood is as follows, for $N$ bins in \HT, let 
$n_{i}$ represent the observed hadronic yield in \HT bin $i$, the likelihood 
for observing $n_{i}$ events is then
\begin{equation}
  L_{had} = \prod_{i}Pois\left(n_{i}|b_{i}+s_{i}\right)
\label{eqn:l_had}
\end{equation}

where $b_{i}$ is the number of expected background events and $s_{i}$ the 
expected signal yield, which is dependant on the signal model being considered.
Pois refers to the Poisson distribution of these values, $b_{i}$ is equal to 
the sum of electro-weak events expected plus the number of QCD events ($b_{i} = 
EWK_{i}+QCD_{i}$) expected per bin.

In Section~\ref{sec:estimating_the_residual_qcd_background_component_} it was 
shown that the QCD contribution can be modelled as an exponentially falling as 
a function of \HT.
\begin{equation}
  R_{\alt}(\HT) = A_{qcd}e^{-\kqcd \HT}
\end{equation}
Where $A_{QCD}$ and \kqcd have been constrained by measurements in the control regions. $QCD_{I}$ is then given as:
\begin{equation}
  QCD_{i} = m_{i}A_{qcd}e^{-\kqcd \left<\HT\right>^{i}}.
  \label{eqn:qcdi}
\end{equation}
Where $m_{i}$ is the number of events per \HT bin which fail \altg and $\left<\HT\right>^{i}$ is the mean \HT of the the bin.


For the electro-weak background two components are considered, $f^{i}_{Zinv}$ represents the fraction of the total electro-weak background contributed by \HepProcess{\PZ\to\Pnu\Pnu}~+~Jets events. This is modelled as a liner component:
\begin{equation}
  f^{i}_{Zinv} = f^{0}_{Zinv}+\frac{\left<\HT\right>^{i}-\left<\HT\right>^{0}}{\left<\HT\right>^{N-1}-\left<\HT\right>^{0}}\left(f^{N-1}_{Zinv}-f^{i}_{Zinv}\right),
\end{equation}
where $f^{i}_{Zinv}$ and $f^{N-1}_{Zinv}$ are floating parameters who's final values are limited between zero and one. The total number of \HepProcess{\PZ\to\Pnu\Pnu}~+~Jets events per bin is then given by:
\begin{equation}
  Z^{i}_{inv} = f^{i}_{Zinv} \times EWK^{i}
  \label{eq:fzinv}
\end{equation}
with the remaining background from other electro-weak processes given by:
\begin{equation}
  Y=\left(1-f^{i}_{Zinv}\right)\times EWK^{i}.
  \label{eq:noZinv}
\end{equation}

In each \HT bin $i$ there are three background measurements, $n_{\Pphoton}^{i}, 
n^{i}_{\mu}$ and $n^{i}_{\mu\mu}$, representing the event counts from the 
photon, muon and di-muon control samples respectively, each of these yields has 
a Montecarlo counter-part yield. From the Montecarlo it is also possible to 
extract $MC^{i}_{Zinv}$ and $MC^{i}_{Y}$. After defining:
\begin{equation}
  r^{i}_{\Pphoton} = \frac{MC^{i}_{\Pphoton}}{MC^{i}_{Zinv}},~ r^{i}_{\mu\mu} = \frac{MC^{i}_{\mu\mu}}{MC^{i}_{Zinv}},~r^{i}_{\mu} = \frac{MC^{i}_{\mu}}{MC^{i}_{Y}}
\end{equation}
three likelihood functions are defined:
\begin{equation}
  L_{\Pphoton} = \prod_{i}Pois\left(n^{i}_\Pphoton|\rho^{j}_{\Pphoton\PZ} \cdot  r^{i}_{\Pphoton}\cdot  Z_{inv}^{i} \right),
  \label{eqn:l_photon}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
  L_{\mu\mu} = \prod_{i}Pois\left(n^{i}_{\mu\mu}|\rho^{j}_{\mu\mu\PZ}\cdot r^{i}_{\mu\mu}\cdot  Z^{i}_{inv}\right),
  \label{eqn:l_mumu}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
  L_{\mu} = \prod_{i}Pois\left(n^{i}_{\mu}|\rho^{j}_{\Pmu Y}\cdot  r^{i}_{\mu}\cdot  Y^{i}+s^{i}_{\mu}\right),
  \label{eqn:l_mu}
\end{equation}
Equation~\eqref{eqn:l_photon} is used to estimate the \ac{ml} values for 
$Z_{inv}$ which is the expectation of the number of 
\HepProcess{\PZ\to\Pnu\Pnu}~+~Jets events in the hadronic signal region using 
the observations $n_{\Pphoton}^{i}$ in the photon control sample and the ratio 
$r^{i}_{\Pphoton}$, similarly the number of \HepProcess{\PZ\to\Pnu\Pnu}~+~Jets 
events expected in the signal region predicted by the 
\HepProcess{\PZ\to\Pmu\Pmu}~+~Jets are found using Equation~\eqref{eqn:l_mumu}. 
The non \HepProcess{\PZ\to\Pnu\Pnu} backgrounds are estimated by the \ac{ml} 
value for Equation~\eqref{eqn:l_mu} in a similar way with the addition of 
$s^{i}_{\Pmu}$ which represents the signal contamination in the single muon 
control sample. The measurements and ratios are considered simultaneously 
though the relationships defined in Equations~\eqref{eqn:l_had}, \eqref{eq:fzinv} and \eqref{eq:noZinv}.
The ratios $r^{i}_{\Pphoton}, r^{i}_{\mu\mu}$ and $r^{i}_{\mu}$ are the inverse 
of the translation factors given by Equation~\eqref{eq:traslationfactor}. The 
parameters $\rho_{\Pphoton\PZ}, \rho_{\mu\mu\PZ}$ and $\rho_{\mu Y}$ 
are correction factors that account for the systematic uncertainty on each of 
the ratios and $\sigma_{\Pphoton\PZ}, \sigma_{\mu\mu\PZ}$ and 
$\sigma_{\mu Y}$ represent the relative systematic uncertainties for 
the control sample constraints, these are accounted for in:
\begin{equation}
  L_{EWK~syst} = \prod_{j}Gaus\left(1.0|\rho_{\mu Y}^{j},\sigma_{\mu Y}^{j}\right)\times Gaus\left(1.0|\rho_{\mu\mu\PZ}^{j},\sigma_{\mu\mu\PZ}^{j}\right)\times Gaus\left(1.0|\rho_{\Pphoton\PZ}^{j},\sigma_{\Pphoton\PZ}^{j}\right)
\end{equation}
Three parameters per control sample are used to cover the eight \HT bins as 
show in Table~\ref{tab:systMap}.
\begin{table}\centering
\caption{The systematic parameters used in \HT bins.}
\label{tab:systMap}
\begin{tabular}{|l|cccccccc|}
\hline
\HT bin ($i$)         & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 \\
\hline
syst. parameter ($j$) & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 2 & 2 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Alternatively the single muon control sample can be used to constrain the total 
electro-weak background, we can define:
\begin{equation}
  r^{\prime i}_{\mu} = \frac{MC^{i}_{\mu}}{MC^{i}_{tot}}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
  L^{\prime}_{\mu} = \prod_{i}Pois\left(n^{i}_{\mu}|\rho_{\mu Y}\times r^{\prime i}_{\mu}\times EWK^{i} + s_{\mu}^{i}\right)
\end{equation}

\paragraph{Signal Contamination} % (fold)
\label{par:signal_contamination}
The cross section for each model is represented by $x$, $l$ represents the 
total recorded luminosity considered by the analysis in the signal region. The 
efficiency is defined as $\epsilon^{i}_{had}$ for the signal region and 
$\epsilon^{i}_{\mu}$ for the single muon control sample, $\delta$ represents 
the relative uncertainty on signal measured in the previous section, $\delta$ 
is taken to be fully correlated though the \HT bins. $\rho_{sig}$ is the 
correction factor to the signal yield which accommodates this uncertainty. 
$f$ represents an unknown multiplicative factor on the signal cross 
section, for which an allowed interval is computed.
The expected signal yield $s^{i}$ from Equation~\eqref{eqn:l_had} is defined as:
\begin{equation}
  s^{i}_{had} = f \rho_{sig}xl\epsilon_{had}^{i},
  \label{eqn:sihad}
\end{equation}
the signal contamination $s^{i}_{\mu}$ is given by:
\begin{equation}
  s^{i}_{\mu} = f \rho_{\mu}xl\epsilon_{\mu}^{i}.
  \label{eqn:simu}
\end{equation}
The systematic on signal uncertainty is included by in an additional term in 
the likelihood:
\begin{equation}
  L_{sig} = Gaus\left(1.0|\rho_{sig},\delta \right).
\end{equation}
% paragraph signal_contamination (end)
\paragraph{The total likelihood} % (fold)
\label{par:the_total_likelihood}
The total likelihood for a given signal selection $k(\HT,n_b)$ is given by:
\begin{equation}
  L^{k} = L^{k}_{had}\times L^{k}_{\mu} \times L_{\Pphoton}^{k} \times L_{\mu\mu}^{k},
  \label{eqn:totallikelihood}
\end{equation}
each $k$ has $3+N$ nuisance parameters; $\mathcal{A}_{QCD}, f^{0}_{Zinv}, 
f^{N-1}_{Zinv}, \left\{EWK^{i}\right\}^{N-1}_{i=0}$. The 11 parameters $\kqcd, 
\rho_{sig}$, and $\rho_{\Pphoton\PZ}^{k}, \rho_{\mu\mu}^{k}, \rho_{\mu}^{k}$ 
with $j = \left\{0,1,2 \right\}$ are shared between the selections, the total 
likelihood is then given as:
\begin{equation}
  L = L_{sig} \times L_{EWK syst} \times \prod_{k} L^{k}_{had} \times L^{k}_{\mu} \times L^{k}_{\Pphoton} \times L^{k}_{\mu\mu}.

\section{Final Results} % (fold)
\label{sec:final_results}
The yields obtained in the hadronic signal regions are tested for their 
compatibility with the background predicted by the likelihood model both in 
terms of agreement with the Standard Model and interpretations in the forms of 
limits on new physics models.

To test the level of agreement with the standard model the signal terms are 
dropped from the likelihood, which is then maximised over all parameters using 
Roofit\cite{ROOSTATS} and MINUIT\cite{MINOS}. The individual yields and errors from the fits are shown in Appendix~\ref{app:enemble}. The total background and data yields and their errors as given by the \ac{ml} fit are show below in Table~\ref{tab:fit-summary}.

Figures~\ref{fig:best-fit-0-btag},~\ref{fig:best-fit-1-btag},~\ref{fig:best-fit-2-btag}~and~\ref{fig:best-fit-3-btag} show comparisons of the observed yields 
and the Standard Model only expectations given by the simultaneous fit for 0, 
1, 2, $\ge3$ exclusive \Pbottom-tag bins. A good agreement with the standard 
model is observed in all \HT and \Pbottom-tag categories. Given the lack of a 
signal like observation limits are set on the production masses and cross 
sections of beyond the standard model particles.
