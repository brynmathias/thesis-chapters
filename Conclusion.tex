\label{cha:conclusion}
The measurements of the \Lone trigger efficiencies relevant for an all hadronic 
\ac{susy} search have been presented, for the region of interest these trigger 
have efficiency of $95\%+$. With this measurement achieved a suite of high 
level triggers are presented, these triggers are analysis specific cutting on 
the \alt variable and the sum of the hadronic energy in the event \HT. This 
allows data collection at very low \HT compared to other HLT trigger paths, 
whilst maintaining a low trigger acceptance rate. The low \HT region is 
important for \ac{susy} searches considering models with compressed spectra as 
the total visible energy in the event is small. The efficiencies of these 
triggers are measured to high precision and these efficiencies and the error on 
them are taken in to account in the final search. Biases and errors due to 
theory, detector effects and analysis choices are quantified and the impact of 
these uncertainties is accounted for in the final interpretation.

The search is interpreted in two ways, firstly the compatibility with the 
\ac{sm} only prediction, a high level of compatibility was observed. With a 
null result limits on the production cross section and masses of new physics 
models which involve a dark matter candidate are set, these results are 
summarised in Table~\ref{tab:sms_summary} for the simplified models. In the 
case of the \ac{cmssm} squarks and gluinos with masses up to \unit{1}{\TeV} are 
excluded.

  \caption{The first three columns define the production and decay
    modes for various simplified models. The last two columns
    indicate the search sensitivity for these models, where
    $m_{\Psquark(\PSgluino)}^{\textrm{best}}$ and
    $m_{\textrm{LSP}}^{\textrm{best}}$ represent the largest mass
    beyond which no limit can be set for squarks/gluinos and the LSP,
    respectively\cite{Chatrchyan:2012wa}.
