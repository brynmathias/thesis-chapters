If Supersymmetry or some other beyond the \ac{sm} theory is to provide a 
yet undiscovered dark matter candidate the \ac{lsp}, it is predicted that this 
candidate will interact via the weak nuclear force only. This gives a decay 
topology involving missing energy in the form of the dark matter particle 
escaping the detector. Due to the nature of interactions at the L.H.C, these 
particles would be produced at the end of a decay chain of heavy particles that 
interact strongly, giving a final topology involving hadronic objects which are 
classified as jets for the purpose of analysis and missing energy.
There are several \ac{sm} processes that mimic this final state.

By far the largest of these backgrounds comes from QCD multi jet events where 
fake missing energy is introduced either from failures in reconstruction, or 
stochastic fluctuations in the calorimeter systems.
\todo[inline]{expand on this - E /sqrt E has non gaussian tails. Figures of 
jets falling below threshold, missed jets etc. probably from some jet-met 
paper.}
However due to the theoretical errors on the QCD production cross section 
predicting the number QCD background events from Montecarlo simulation is not 
possible. A secondary QCD background also exists, where due to the requirement 
of a jet \ET threshold, multiple jets fall under threshold by a few \GeV, this 
causes a balanced event to look unbalanced as the jets under threshold are no 
longer considered. It is these sources of QCD background that \alt is designed 
to remove.

The second major background comes from \ac{sm} electro-weak decays and 
is irreducible as the final states involve real missing energy, from 
neutrinos. The electro-weak decays that form the back ground are 
\HepProcess{\PW\to\Ptau\Pnu} + Jets, where the $\tau$ is reconstructed as a 
jet, or the lepton fails the identification required for the dedicated lepton 
vetoes, \HepProcess{\PZ\to\Pnu\APnu} + Jets is completely irreducible. These 
are generally di-jet topologies. At higher jet multiplicities top quark 
production followed by semi-leptonic top decay accounts of the largest 
background. These backgrounds are predicted using a well understood control 
sample this is fully explained in 
Section~\ref{sec:electro_weak_background_prediciton}.

The final background source is that introduced by detector failure or 
electronic noise induced by the movement of the L.H.C proton beam.
Approximately 1$\%$ of the ECAL read out is not available in offline event 
reconstruction, this provides a source of fake missing energy.
