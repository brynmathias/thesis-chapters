The scientific method gives us a framework from which to quantify the world 
around us, experiment drives theory and theory drives the search for new 
observables. This continual positive feedback loop has driven revolutions in 
both technology application and the understanding of the fundamental processes 
seen in nature. The result of this is the ability to describe the motion of the 
stars and galaxies in the night sky using General Relativity and the 
interactions of the fundamental particles which are described by the \ac{sm}.

% The key factor in mankind's success is the ability to abstract, experiment, 
% quantify and learn from our surroundings and experiments. Over time this 
% ability has improved, from making fire to shaping stones and metal to form 
% tools. This understanding of our surroundings now allows us to harness energy 
% directly from nuclear processes. Our understanding is built upon rigorous 
% mathematical foundation, we can successfully describe the motion of planets, 
% stars and galaxies using \ac{gr} and the interactions of the fundamental 
% particles are described by the \ac{sm} of particle physics.

However our understanding is incomplete, we are currently unable to produce a 
combined description of gravity and the interactions of fundamental particles. 
If our ideal of having some unified model which describes all dynamical 
interactions in the universe is to be fulfilled then some model which describes 
both of these regimes is desired.
Our current best model, the \ac{sm} predicts no dark matter, which has been 
conclusively inferred from cosmological observations. For example the 
rotational curves of the M33 galaxy\cite{Corbelli1999af} show that the amount 
of visible mass is not enough to confine the stars at the edges given their 
velocities as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:M33RotationalCurve}.

So far it is unknown if we are on the correct path with our descriptions of 
the universe at high energies and short time scales, experimentally our 
theories are supported. However, as they are built on conjecture it is impossible to divine how nature works outside of our experimental range.
With this in mind the \ac{lhc} was designed and built to test our theories and 
search for the missing component (the Higgs Boson) of the \ac{sm} at previously 
unattainable energy scales.

The \ac{lhc} is a particle accelerator and collider, two counter 
rotating beams of protons are collided at four interaction points around its 
circumference. At design capacity these collisions occur every 
\unit{25}{\nano\second} or at a rate of 40 million times per second.
The accelerator is situated in the \ac{lep} tunnel at CERN on the 
Franco-Swiss border. At \unit{27}{\kilo\meter} in circumference it is the 
largest machine on Earth. It is constructed from 1624 niobium-titanium 
superconducting magnets, cooled to \unit{1.8}{\kelvin} which produce a maximum 
field strength of \unit{8.36}{\tesla}, this magnetic field is used to bend the 
trajectories of the proton beams so they move in a circular path.

Protons are to be collided at a design centre-of-mass energy of 
\unit{14}{\TeV}, however design energy has not yet been realised, instead two 
runs, one at \unit{7}{\TeV} and the other at \unit{8}{\TeV} have been 
performed. The beams are collided to give an instantaneous luminosity of up to 
\unit{$1\times10^{34}$}{\lumiunits}, with a maximum instantaneous luminosity of 
\unit{$\approx 7 \times 10^{33}$}{\lumiunits} delivered during the 2012 run.

Figure~\ref{fig:figures_Introduction_xsec} shows the production cross sections 
of \ac{sm} and \ac{bsm} processes. To disentangle the already discovered 
low \pt physics from Electroweak and new unseen processes requires 
highly sophisticated particle detectors, four of which are employed at CERN for 
the \ac{lhc}. These consist of two general purpose detectors: 
ATLAS\cite{ref:atlas} and \ac{cms}\cite{ref:cms} the latter of which is 
described in detail in Chapter~\ref{cha:the_cms_detector}. The other two 
detectors are specialised. LHCb\cite{ref:lhcb} is designed to study 
charge-parity violation in the \Pbottom sector and perform precision 
measurements of the \ac{sm}. The ALICE\cite{ref:alice} experiment is designed to 
study the quark-gluon plasma when the \ac{lhc} is running in its secondary 
mode and colliding heavy ions, for example lead.


The low production cross sections for ``interesting'' new events mean that 
choosing which events to write out for later analysis and which events to 
reject is highly important and requires complex algorithms. This thesis covers 
triggering and a search for beyond the \ac{sm} physics, which produces a dark 
matter candidate particle, using the data collected. In the absence of 
discovery, limits are set on the production cross section and mass scale of new 
physics models.

% The (\ac{lhc}) \cite{Benedikt:823808} is a proton-proton collider which is situated in the Large Electron Positron
% (LEP) tunnel approximately 100 m under the franco-swiss border. Design centre of mass energy is 14 TeV with an instantaneous
% luminosity of $ 1 \times 10$e$^{34}$cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$. However during 2011 the centre of mass energy was 7 TeV and the maximum
% luminosity was $ 5 \times 10$e$^{33}$ cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$.
% To achieve this high energy and high beam current the \ac{lhc} uses superconducting niobium-titanium magnets, cooled to a temperature of 
% 1.8 Kelvin, that produce a maximum field strength of 8.36 Tesla.
% 
% \todo[inline]{we might well need some more stuff about the \ac{lhc} its self in here!}
% 
% Situated around the \ac{lhc} ring are four detectors, two general detectors ATLAS \cite{Akesson:1999uv} and CMS (see
% Chapter~\ref{cha:the_cms_detector} for a detailed discussion of the CMS detector) \cite{Friedl:1140134}\cite{Wulz:vf} which are  designed to measure the \ac{sm} to high precision and search for new physics. The \ac{lhc} beauty experiment 
% \cite{Rademacker:2005tx} is designed to study at previously unattainable precision the decays of heavy quark 
% flavors, both to measure the \ac{sm} couplings and to search for beyond the \ac{sm} (BSM) physical processes. Finally
% the ALICE \cite{Alessandro:2006ht} experiment is designed to run when the \ac{lhc} is running in it's secondary mode where rather than
% proton bunches, lead ions are collided, in an effort to study the quark-gluon plasma.
