The \ac{cms} detector was designed and built to study proton-proton 
interactions at the \ac{lhc} with the aim of discovering the Higgs boson and 
searching for beyond the standard model physics signals. The detector is 
constructed in a traditional onion layer design with high precision tracking 
detectors nearest the interaction point and high energy resolution calorimetric 
detectors in the outer layers. Due to the predicted presence of missing energy \MET in new physics models, energy measurement over the full $\eta$ range is required. As allured to in the name the possibilities of the new physics models containing muons and the clean Higgs decay \HepProcess{\PH\to\PZ\PZ\to\Pmu\Pmu\Pmu\Pmu}, the detector was built with accurately reconstructing muons with \PT of \unit{1}{\TeV}, due to the prevalence of lepton signals and the ability to distinguish these leptons from the large amount of hadronic fragmentation caused by smashing two protons together at a centre of mass energy of \unit{14}{\TeV} the \ac{cms} Electromagnetic calorimeter was also designed to have precise energy measurement and fine grain spatial resolution, this design feature was also necessitated by the Higgs decay channel \HepProcess{\PH\to\Pphoton\Pphoton}.The other new feature of \ac{cms} is the use silicon detectors through out for particle tracking these give precise track reconstruction abilities and the associated fine grain resolution in both position and momentum. All the sub-detectors save the muon system are contained with in the barrel of a \unit{4}{\tesla} superconducting solenoid. This magnet provides the particle track bending required for momentum and lepton charge measurement.In this section the key detector elements and their design parameters are discussed in Section~\ref{cha:offline_object_deffinitions} the construction of offline physics objects is discussed.

\end{figure}

The design goal for the \ac{cms} tracking system was to produce a system that 
can precisely and efficiently measure the trajectories of charged particles 
produced in \ac{lhc} collisions. The tracking system surrounds the collision 
point and has a length of \unit{5.8}{\meter} and a diameter of 
\unit{2.5}{\meter}. At full the instantaneous \ac{lhc} luminosity of 
\unit{10$^{34}$}{\lumiunits} an average of 1000 charged particles from more 
than 20 proton-proton interactions will be produced per \unit{25}{\nano\second} 
bunch crossing. This imposes the requirements of high granularity so that the 
individual particles and their trajectories can be distinguished and a fast 
response so that the hits can be assigned to the correct bunch crossing. The 
technical implications of these requirements imply both a large amount of 
on-detector electronics and their associated cooling equipment. This large 
amount of tracker material increases the multiple scattering, bremsstrahlung, 
photon conversion and nuclear interactions of the particles which are 
traversing the tracking system, this in turn limits the position and energy 
resolution of the calorimeter systems. A compromise between the material budget 
of the tracking system, the desired features and the requirement for the 
tracking system to have an expected life time of 10 years in a high radiation 
environment, this was to construct the tracking system using only solid state 
silicon detector technology.

The \ac{cms} tracking system is formed of a pixel detector with three layers 
situated between \unit{4.4}{\cm} and \unit{10.2}{\cm} of the interaction point 
and a silicon strip tracker with 10 barrel layers extending outwards to a 
radius of \unit{1.1}{\meter} from the interaction point. The barrel layers of 
both the pixel and strip detectors are complimented by layers of either pixel 
or strip disks which extend the acceptance of the tracker to \mETA $<$ 2.5. The 
resulting structure is that of a detector with \unit{200}{\squaremetre} of 
active silicon which makes the \ac{cms} tracker the largest detector of it's 
type ever constructed.

The individual pixels that comprise the pixel detector are 100 $\times$ 
150 $\micro\textrm{m}^{2}$ which corresponds to an occupancy of around 10$^{-4}$ 
per bunch crossing. The detector cell size for the Microstrip detectors at a 
radius between \unit{20-55}{\cm} is \unit{10}{\cm} $\times$ 
\unit{180}{\micro\meter} which leads to an average occupancy of 2-3$\%$, 
further out the minimum cell size is increased to \unit{25}{\cm} $\times$ 
\unit{180}{\micro\meter} with an occupancy of around 1$\%$. The tracker 
performance is extensively documented in \cite{cmstracking}.

\section{The Electromagnetic Calorimeter (ECAL).} % (fold)
\label{sec:the_electromagnetic_calorimeter}
The \ac{cms} electromagnetic calorimeter is a hermetic homogeneous calorimeter 
constructed from lead tungstate (PbWO$_{4}$) crystals. The ECAL is split into 
two parts, a barrel covering $|\eta| < 1.479$ read out by avalanche photodiodes 
and the two end-caps covering $1.479 < |\eta| < 3.0$, read out by vacuum 
phototriodes.

Lead tungstate crystals were chosen because of their short radiation length 
$X_{0}= \unit{0.89}{\cm}$, fast scintillation and radiation hardness. During 
the research and development program it was shown that radiation damage does 
not affect the scintillation method or the uniformity of the emitted light 
yield along the crystal, it only effects the transparency through the creation 
of colour centres. This will be monitored throughout the lifetime of the ECAL 
via a light injection system\cite{Smith:2000p5245}.

The barrel crystals have a front face of \unit{22 $\times$ 22}{\mm\squared}, 
this corresponds to the Moliere radius of $\approx $ \unit{22}{\mm}; with a 
length of \unit{230}{\mm} giving a each crystal length of $25.8 X_{0}$ where 
$X_{0}$ is amount of material required for 68$\%$ of an electromagneticly 
interacting particle's energy to be radiated in the form of bremsstrahlung or 
pair production whilst traversing that material. They are arranged in 36 
super-modules, forming two half barrels. The crystal axes are skewed at 
\unit{3}{\degree} with respect to the vertex and each covers \unit{1}{\degree} 
in $\phi ~ \& ~ \eta$

The End cap crystals are arranged in two semi-circular `Dees', groups of 
$5\times 5$ crystals are canter-levered on a aluminium backing plate. The 
crystals are again skewed with regard to the interaction vertex, however they 
are arranged in an $x-y$ grid rather than a $\phi - \eta$ grid. The crystal 
dimensions are different to the barrel, in that the cross section is \unit{28.6 
$\times$ 28.6}{\mm\squared}, with a length of \unit{220}{\mm} corresponding to 
24.7 radiation lengths

The crystals are read out with avalanche photo-diodes in the barrel region which coveres $\mETA < 1.479$ and with vacuum photo-triodes in the end cap region which covers $1.479 < \mETA < 3.0$.

In addition to the ECAL there is a pre-shower detector situated at $1.653 < 
\mETA < 2.6$, this provides identification of elections against minimum 
ionising particles and improves the position measurement of electrons and 
photons in the ECAL endcaps.

  \caption{Relative response to laser light (440 nm) measured by the ECAL laser 
monitoring system, averaged over all crystals in bins of pseudo-rapidity, for 
the 2011 and 2012 data taking periods 
The response change observed in the ECAL channels is of the order of a few 
percent in the barrel, while it reaches up to 25$\%$ in the most forward endcap 
regions used for electron and photon reconstruction. The response change is up 
to 60$\%$ in channels closest to the beam pipe. These measurements are used to 
correct the physics data. \\ The bottom plot shows the instantaneous LHC 
luminosity delivered during this time period.\cite{CMS-DP-2012-015}}

\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:figures_CMS_laser_history_2011-12} shows the change in response 
of the ECAL during running, due to the formation of colour centres, this 
response is measured using laser light at 440 nm and is used to correct the 
energies recorded in data during each run to form a uniform response.

\section{The Hadronic Calorimeter (HCAL).} % (fold)
\label{sec:the_hadronic_calorimeter}
The design of the \ac{cms} HCAL is constrained by the resize requirements of 
fitting the tracking system, ECAL and HCAl inside the solenoid magnet. The HCAL 
is situated between the ECAL which ends at a radius of \unit{1.77}{\meter} and 
the solenoid which starts at a radius of \unit{2.95}{\meter}. This constraint 
limits the amount of material which can be put in place to fully contain the 
hadronic showers. To overcome this an outer lay of instrumentation is placed 
outside of the magnet and cryogenic system to catch the hadronic tails. The 
full containment of the hadronic objects is necessary for precise missing 
energy measurement, which is a key discriminatory feature for new physics 
models with undetectable final state particles.

The hadronic calorimeter is split in to three sub detectors, the hadronic 
barrel (HB) \mETA $< 1.3$ , hadronic endcaps (HE) $1.3 < \mETA < 3.0$ and a 
forward calorimeter (HF) $3.0 < \mETA < 5.5$.
\todo[inline]{put in the dimensions of the plates, the read outs and the HPD info. this should flush this out enough.}
The HB and HE are comprised of layered tiles of brass absorber plates 
interspaced with scintillator plates which are read out by wave length shifting 
fibres. The total absorber thickness varies between 5.2 and 10.6 interaction 
lengths, the ECAL adds approximately one extra interaction length.
The HF is constructed from radiation hard quartz fibres, this enables the 
detector to survive in the very forward regions of the detector where 
unprecedented levels of radiation are experienced.

The hadronic outer (HO) which is situated outside the solenoid used the 
solenoid coils as an extra absorber adding extra interaction lengths in the 
barrel region ensuring full containment of hadronic showers. The HO is 
constructed from layers of scintillator tiles which are then read out by 
wavelength shifting fibres.
